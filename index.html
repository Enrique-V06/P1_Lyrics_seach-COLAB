                <pre>
                    With eyes wide shut we lay stagnant awake
                    Safe for now in this wonderous state
                    Lost at a crossroad that's missing a sign
                    How do we know if they made it alive
                    There's something lurking in the distance ahead
                    Fragments of light shine away from the dead
                    They fantasize fury, no time left to stop
                    Its darkness approaching now we're at a loss
                    Sometimes, when all that's lost remains
                    Drink from the fountain of youth and never age again
                    Sometimes we jump across to every cloud
                    Fly away get lost and never be found
                    Sometimes, when all that's lost remains
                    Drink from the fountain of youth and never age again
                    Sometimes we jump across to every cloud
                    Fly away get lost and never be found
                    There's something lurking from the shadows within
                    Stealing the colour and life from my skin
                    They fantasize fury at no extra cost
                    Darkness approaches now we're at a loss
                    Ah
                    Ah
                    Sometimes, when all that's lost remains
                    Drink from the fountain of youth and never age again
                    Sometimes we jump across to every cloud
                    Fly away get lost and never be found
                    Sometimes, when all that's lost remains
                    Drink from the fountain of youth and never age again
                    Sometimes we jump across to every cloud
                    Fly away get lost and never be found
                    Never be found,
                    Never be found (Ah)
                    Never be found (Ah)
                    Never be found (Ah)
                    Ah
