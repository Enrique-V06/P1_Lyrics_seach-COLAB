# Project_1_web_development

As a music enthusiast, I want to easily search for a song by title, artist, or even a snippet of lyrics, so that I can quickly find the information and lyrics I need to better understand and enjoy my favorite tracks. Using a music search engine that integrates with the MusiXMatch and Words APIs, I can easily search for a song and get detailed information about it, including album art and related information. Additionally, I can view a related picture that adds context and atmosphere to the music. This will help me broaden my musical horizons, discover new artists and songs, and have a richer music listening experience overall.
